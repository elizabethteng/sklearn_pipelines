# Next Steps in Python: Scikit-Learn Pipelines (Virtual)

Would you like to simplify your machine learning code and minimize repetitive tasks? Scikit-Learn's pipelines can help you organize and streamline your data processing and model training, as well as make your code cleaner and easier to manage. In this workshop, we will cover why and how to use pipelines in your machine learning code. 

Prerequisites: Participants should be familiar with Python at the level of the Python Fundamentals Bootcamp, another introductory Python workshop, or be a self-taught Python coder. Basic familiarity with machine learning and Scikit-Learn is required.
